The module tests are run by *.t files in the t directory. But once you
have 'make'd the module, you can try these commands (from the t
directory) to see what Test::Usage output looks like:

  cd t
  perl -I../lib -MM1_T -e test

  perl -I../lib -MTest::Usage -e files
  perl -I../lib -MTest::Usage -e 'files( t => {v => 2, c => 0})'

If you omit the -I option, the currently installed (if any)
Test::Usage will run.
