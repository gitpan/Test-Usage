TODO

. Use configuration file for default options to test() and files();
named .testusage; searched for in same place as Usage.pm, $HOME. If it
doesn't exist, don't use it.

. Allow files() to take a list of files as an argument, in addition
to/instead of the 'd' option.

. Explain what type of glob a and e match. Make the globs a bit
smarter, allowing for example 'a[123]'.

. Test accepts and excludes.

. Warn (die?) if test labels are duplicated.

. Running under debug...

. In addition to ok(), maybe it would be nice to have methods similar
  to the ones supplied by the other Perl Test modules, like;

  is  ($this, $that, $test_name);
  isnt($this, $that, $test_name);
  like  ($this, qr/that/, $test_name);
  unlike($this, qr/that/, $test_name);
  cmp_ok($this, '==', $that, $test_name);
  can_ok($module, @methods);
  isa_ok($object, $class);
  pass($test_name);
  fail($test_name);

    # I'd like methods like these to be generally available, not
    # buried inside a test module.
  is_deeply($complex_structure1, $complex_structure2, $test_name);
  eq_array(\@this, \@that);
